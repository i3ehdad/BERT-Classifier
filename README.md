# <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction to the BERT Language Model


With the breakthrough of "Transfer Learning" in Natural Language Processing (NLP), the landscape has been completely transformed. Regarded as "Language Modelling” in the NLP landscape, Transfer learning can exploit almost infinite amount of unlabelled textual data to get dynamic representations of word vectors as oppose to the static word vectors generated by the early NLP models. The main idea behind language modelling was to pre-train an extremely large unsupervised model on a NLP tasks to generate and ‘Transfer’ the contextually aware words vectors acquired to a downstream task at hand. In addition to this, the development of “Transformers” by Google AI in a paper called "Attention is all you need”, came over the limiting properties of the gradient based learning algorithms in RNN’s (Recurrent Neural Networks). 


As opposed to the sequential processing of RNN’s, Transformers can perform input processing in parallel, enabling them to deal with larger corpora more efficiently. Being non-sequential and able to process sentences as a whole, transformers utilised a novel technique called ‘Multi Head Self-Attention’ to ‘Attend’ to words and their context throughout the entire sentence and learn the contextual relationship between different words. This was in contrast to previous recurrent based models such as LSTM’s, which captured word dependencies by relying on the past hidden states, which lead to the risk of losing and forgetting past information. 

With these developments, the "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers" (BERT) was introduced. Regarded as "conceptually simple and empirically powerful" by the Google researchers, BERT was pre-trained on two unsupervised tasks; Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) and Masked Language Model (MLM). The combination of the two enabled BERT to alleviate the unidirectionality limitation of the previous GPT model. Bidirectionallity being the most emphasised innovative feature by the researchers, BERT has outperformed all the previous models in most of the NLP tasks, particularly in sentiment classification.

# <a name="Bertweet"></a> BERTweet: A pre-trained language model for English Tweets 

The effectiveness of BERT in achieving state of the art results and its comparatively easy adoption in various NLP tasks as oppose to the previous complex neural network architecture design has lead BERT to be the most adopted language model. While BERT has been very effective in processing general language tasks, its adoption in domain specific areas has brought to attention few shortcomings, as it has been trained on generic Wikipedia and open-source news articles. This has led to the introduction of various domain and topic specific BERTs such as SciBERT (for scientific text), FinBERT (for financial text), BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and LawBERT. Similarly, the BERTweet language model was introduced for Twitter focused NLP tasks. 

the characteristics of the typical Twitter post is very different from more traditional written texts such as Wikipedia and newspaper articles. Unlike conventional language, tweets and other forms social media communication, are generally based on informal grammar and more than often contain irregular vocabulary such as abbreviations, typos, hashtags and odd spellings. Hence, having been trained on only on formal text with regular vocabulary, the BERT model might not be as effective as it has been on tasks with common and non-specific language. The BERTweet variant was developed and pretrained by "VinAI Research", which is the "first public large-scale language model pre-trained for English Tweets. BERTweet is trained based on the [RoBERTa](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/roberta/README.md) pre-training procedure. The corpus used to pre-train BERTweet consists of 850M English Tweets (16B word tokens ~ 80GB), containing 845M Tweets streamed from 01/2012 to 08/2019 and 5M Tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic". To further explore the architecture and experimental results refer to the [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-demos.2/) by VinAI Research.

The superiority of language models in terms of performance and simplicity in contrast to the previously complex neural architecture design needed for a sufficient performance is their distinguishing factor. Hence, multiple and complex layering is not necessary in the case of language models and could in fact lead to overfitting. The overall procedure of fine-tuning a language model can be intuitively explained as adding a task specific 'head' to the 'end' of the language model. In this implementation of the BERTweet model, BERTweets’s contextualised embeddings will be the input to a 2 layer feed forward neural network classifier. The fine-tuning procedure and evaluation can be found in [BERTweet](https://github.com/i3ehdad/BERT-Sentiment-Classifier/blob/main/BERTweet.ipynb) module and the visualisation of this process can be depicted as below:
